<h1>As the CEO of Google, what product would you remove from the Gsuite?</h1>

<b>Google's</b> mission has been to make information accessible to everyone. In view of this, Google initially started out as a search engine company but now has diversified into different segments including hardware consumer products as well.<br>

<b>Google Rewards</b> is the product that needs to be removed. Google Rewards is an app that provides its users Google Play cash upon filling surveys which normally includes rating the relevancy of certain questions and questions based on the activities of each user when they interact with the Gsuite. Users of this app would be required to have a Google account so that the amount can be credited directly to the users Google Play account.<br>

Here's how the user journey works:
<li>User opens the app</li><br>
<li>Gets a pop-up requesting for inputs on a survey</li><br>
<li>Completes survey based on their opinions</li><br>
<li>Gets credited a certain amount upon completion</li><br>

The initiative behind the app was brilliant as this was one of the channels to collect feedback from end-users while also paying them a small thank you amount for their inputs. Overall it was a win-win situation for both parties.<br>

While Google Rewards seems relevant, there are a few pros and cons for the same.<br>

Pros:<br>
1. Simple UI: Very easy to understand and complete the survey in a short duration<br>
2. Monetization factor: Users who complete the survey are credited an amount unique to how they would fill the survey<br>

Cons:<br>
1. Bad frequency of surveys: The surveys are sent to users randomly during a month, it can vary from 2 times to about 4 times per month. Due to this, retention is really low, as a lot of users who don't get notifications about this will not check the app for the same<br>
2. Amount is credited to Google Play only: As the amount credited upon completion goes to the Google Play wallet, it cannot be used outside of the Gsuite apps. As a result, users are reluctant to use the same until the accumulate the amount by a very large extent then use the same<br>
3. Amount credited depends on the users inputs:  Surveys given on the app would pay users depending on how honest they gave their opinions. There is no factor/attribute deciding how a user should be paid and how much does the user get upon answering the questions<br>

In view of the above pros and cons, Google Rewards has not been game-changing yet there is a lot of scope for improvement. <br>

<li>While surveys are one way of going about getting feedback, Google could monetize generic feedback that is provided across the entire Gsuite, instead of rating the honesty factor, The more legitimate feedback a user provides, the more amount he/she is paid. </li>

<li>Another major improvement is linking the amount generated to the Google Pay account. This way, users do not fall for phishing scams where apps promise to convert the Google Play amount to cash and take a commission fee from end-users.</li>
