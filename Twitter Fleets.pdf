<h5><b>Twiiter</b> is planning on closing down it's Fleets feature, what are the reasons as to why the company decided to do so? </h5>

<b>Twitter</b> is a social media company that allows users to post tweets (This can be textual, images, audio, or video). This is a platform that is commonly used to bring about information dissemination instantly when you want to reach large crowds. <br> 

When we think of the users of Twitter as a product, we can segment these users into 3 major buckets:<br>
1. Regular users<br>
2. Advertisers<br>
3. Political representatives/diplomats<br>

<li>Regular users are those users who like tweets, browse through the tweets, and maybe post tweets themselves.<br></li>

<li>Advertisers use Twitter to post their ads on Twitter in the hope of acquiring new users for the product they are advertising.<br></li>

<li>Political representatives/diplomats make use of Twitter to disseminate important announcements, news about the party that they represent or try to gain traction by showcasing the work they have done.<br></li>

When we look at the competitors of Twitter:<br>
1. Facebook<br>
2. Pinterest<br>
3. LinkedIn<br>
4. Snapchat and Instagram<br>

Twitter launched a feature called Twitter Fleets a few months back which worked on showing a post for a limited time frame.<br>
So a user may post a fleet and it would be there on the platform for 24 hours post which Twitter automatically deletes the post. This could be found in the form of a circular post.<br>

There are various pros and cons when it comes to this feature:<br>

Pros:<br>
1. Users who wished to show their tweets just for 24 hours could do so without having to worry about the repercussions of their tweets.<br>
2. Enables users to find relevant material faster and makes the entire UI less cluttered.<br>
3. Users who wished to reply to a fleet could instantly do so without having to read through the entire thread which comes with the tweet.<br>

Cons:
1. This feature was already present on Instagram in the form of stories which made this feature not so appealing because Twitter as a platform is very different from that of Instagram.<br>
2. Tweets are meant for information dissemination or trying to have a conversation with a stranger without having to dm them separately. Featuring a tweet on the fleet does not solve the problem of gaining traction.<br>
3. Twitter is also a platform where there are a lot of instances where there is a lot of rumors and false information that is being spread on the platform.<br>

In view of the above pros and cons, this feature came at a time in India where Twitter is facing a lot of problems with the Indian govt with regards to privacy.<br>

Indian govt. was pressuring Twitter to be able to decrypt the tweets and figure out the source of each false tweet when demanded by the govt.<br>
This goes against the principle of Twitter and this feature did not help with this situation.<br>

Some metrics that may have been considered to figure out if this feature was to continue or not are as follows:<br>

<li>No. Of DAU/MAU (Can be measured in the number of times a user posts a fleet in a day or a month and the frequency of users who open these fleets on a daily/monthly basis)</li><br>
<li>No. Of times users comment on fleets on a regular basis.</li><br>

Since there was no major pain-point that this feature was solving, it wasn't considered as a game-changing feature. This is what lead to the sunset of this feature.
