<h1>Top Metrics to keep a track of for Netflix as a company</h1>

<b>Netflix</b> is a company that provides asynchronous videos in the form of videos, movies, TV shows and interactive shows as well. In terms of the breadth of its services, they offer streaming options on TVs, Web application and mobile devices as well. As a company in the video streaming space, the major competitors are Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and Hulu. They go by the tagline "See what's next".<br>
<br>
The pricing plans of Netflix are really attractive and competitive to other platforms as well.<br>
When we look at the plans, some plans are inexpensive yet, they limit streaming to one device, while other plans are present which provide multiple streaming devices with multiple profiles for the same account.<br>

Based on the above pricing plans, users can be differentiated as follows:<br>

1. Users who use the single device streaming service.<br>
2. Users who buy the yearly package<br>
3. Users who use accounts of those who have opted for multiple profiles.<br>

In terms of usage, users can be differentiated on the basis of Age criteria and Genre criteria.<br>

Age:<br>
Segmentation can vary from Kids -> Elderly<br>
Let's break that down as follows:<br>
<li>Kids and young adults as one segment</li><br>
<li>Adults as another segment (Working Professionals)</li><br>
<li>Elderly as the last segment</li><br>

When we keep the company's health dashboard as the primary objective, we will be concerned on various factors. Hence we will focus on only a few segments of users.<br>

1. Users who purchase the single device streaming service<br>
2. Used who pay for the yearly deals<br>
3. Adults usage of Netflix as a service<br>

Looking at the metrics for evaluation:<br>

1. Number of DAU/MAU<br>
2. Hours spent by users on the service<br>
3. Number of times users come back to use the service<br>
4. Number of users who purchase the subscription plans<br>

In terms of prioritisation, <br>
I would focus on the 4th metric as my North Star metric, then I would track the 3rd metric after which the 2nd and then the 1st metric.

Here's the reasons as to why I would choose these metrics:<br>

<li>No. Of users purchasing subscription plans-<br>

Helps us keep a track of how much revenue we make as a company and which subscription plan is attracting maximum customers. This will help us cater to that domain and help convert those users into better subscription plans by providing more incentives from our end.<br>

<li>Retention rate-<br>
On an average per week, how many times do users come back to Netflix and watch shows/movies. This helps us keep track of users in terms of actual usage because if there's a big gap in the usage then we would be able to identify those users who are probably opting out of Netflix and moving to other platforms or any other reasons as to why they aren't using our platform.<br>

<li>No. Of hours spent by users-<br>
This would help us identify what genre are users watching and help us curate content and provide relevant recommendations to users so that they don't need to waste time searching for a good show to watch. This in turn makes the User experience much much better.<br>

<li>Number of DAU/MAU-<br>
Users who continue to use our service may disable their accounts after a certain time period due to different reasons. Advertising our service to those users makes it important for us to attract customers to continue to use our service without ever getting bored.<br>
